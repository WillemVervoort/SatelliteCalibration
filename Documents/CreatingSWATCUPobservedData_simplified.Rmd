# Introduction  
This is an introduction into developing SWAT CUP inout files using R, written for the "How do I use satellite and global reanalysis data for hydrological simulations in SWAT?" workshop in Montevideo between 7 - 11 August 2017, jointly organised by the University of Sydney, IRI (the University of Columbia) and INIA, Uruguay.

# Functions to prepare SWAT-CUP files for the calibration and validation routine
This file demonstrates the use of two auxillary functions to create input data for SWAT calibration in SWAT-CUP, which can be called by using:
```{r sourceFunctions}
source("functions/SWATCUPfunctions.R")
```
  
There are 2 functions.  

* `MODIS_ts()` to transform the MODIS data to a timeseries, we have seen this function already in the calibration of the rainfall runoff model. Here we use the same function.  
* `swatcup_ETformat()` the function that generates the different files depending on the inputs given.

# MODIS_ts
This function reads the directory indicated by *MODISdir* and looks for files with the extension pattern given by *patt*. The output is a timeseries of values stacked for all the points that are available. There are 5 columns in the output:  

* Year  
* JDay (Julian Day)  
* value (of actual ET in mm)  
* Point (a number in the catchment)  
* Date (the actual date in Y-m-d)

```{r MODIS_ts}
# demonstrate
# Create a single file with all the MODIS ET data for all points
ET_Data <- MODIS_ts("MODIS/SantaLucia")
# show the data
head(ET_Data)

```


# swatcup_ETformat
This function encapsulates a few separate functions and uses them to write the input files for SWAT-CUP in the right format for both ET and flow data.
It can write:  

- observed.txt
- observed_sub.txt
- observed_rch.txt

This function takes the following input

* df, this is a data frame with flow data or ET data, the output of `MODIS_ts()`
* df_flow this is an optional dataframe with flow data if df is ET data
* date.format is a definition of the date format in case the date format in the flow data is incorrect
* st.date: the starting date for the output
* end.date: the end date for the output
* outfile: the SWAT-CUP file you want to write
* infile: the SWAT-CUP file you use as template
* nlines: the number of lines in the header
* Flow: a boolean indicating whether or not flow data is included
* weight: a single number or a vector indicating the weight of the flow data relative to the other input data. The objective function weights will be $weight*flow + \sum{weight/np*Obs_i}$  

```{r swatcup_ETformat}
# Demonstrate: writing files for 2008 - 2011
# read in flow data
flowdata <- readRDS(file="data/SantaLucia.RDS")
head(flowdata)
# original Q is in m^3/sec
# SWAT needs cumecs

# write observed_sub.txt
swatcup_ETformat(ET_Data, df_flow = NULL, date.format = "%Y-%m-%d",
                             "2008-01-01", "2011-12-31",
                 "data/observed_sub.txt" ,
                 "data/observed_sub.txt", 6, weight= 0.1)



# write observed.txt
swatcup_ETformat(ET_Data, df_flow = flowdata,
                 date.format = "%Y-%m-%d",
                 "2006-01-01", "2011-12-31",
                 "data/observed.txt" ,
                 "data/observed.txt", 14, Flow = TRUE, 
                 weight = 0.1)

# write observed_rch.txt
swatcup_ETformat(flowdata,df_flow=NULL,
                 date.format = "%Y-%m-%d",
                 "2008-01-01", "2011-12-31",
                 "data/observed_rch.txt" ,
                 "data/observed_rch.txt", 6, 
                 Flow = TRUE)

# Now test putting in weights relative to the size of the subcatchment
subbasin_data <- read.csv("data/subbasins_SantaLucia_alldata.csv")

# calculate weights from relative areas
f_w <- 0.1 # flow weight
ET_w <- subbasin_data$Area/sum(subbasin_data$Area)*(1-f_w)
 w_in <- c(f_w, ET_w)

 # now try to write the file
swatcup_ETformat(ET_Data, df_flow = flowdata,
                  date.format = "%Y-%m-%d",
                  "2008-01-01", "2011-12-31",
                  "data/observed.txt" ,
                 "data/observed.txt", 14, 
                 Flow = TRUE, weight = w_in)
