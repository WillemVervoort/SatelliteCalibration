# Introduction  
This is an introduction into developing SWAT CUP inout files using R, written for the "How do I use satellite and global reanalysis data for hydrological simulations in SWAT?" workshop in Montevideo between 7 - 11 August 2017, jointly organised by the University of Sydney, IRI (the University of Columbia) and INIA, Uruguay.

# Functions to prepare SWAT-CUP files for the calibration and validation routine
This file demonstrates the use of three auxillary functions to create input data for SWAT calibration in SWAT-CUP, which can be called by using:
```{r sourceFunctions}
source("functions/SWATCUPfunctions.R")
```
  
There are 3 functions.  

* `swatcup_MFformat()` a function hat generates observed.txt and observed_rch.txt files depending on the inputs given for a list of data frames with either a single flow station, or with multiple flow stations.  
* `MODIS_ts()` a function to transform the MODIS data to a timeseries for the different pixels in the MODIS image.    
* `swatcup_ETformat()` a function that generates observed.txt and observed_rch.txt files depending on the inputs given for either a single flow station or a combination of a single flow station and ET data.

# swatcup_MFformat
This function encapsulates a few separate functions and uses them to write the input files for SWAT-CUP in the right format for multiple flow data.
It can write:  

- observed.txt
- observed_rch.txt

This function takes the following input

* df_flow, this is a list of data frames with flow data, which have two columns: "Date" and "Flow".
* date.format is a definition of the date format in case the date format in the flow data is incorrect
* st.date: the starting date for the output, **this needs to be within all the different data sets that you would like to use.**
* end.date: the end date for the output
* outfile: the SWAT-CUP file you want to write
* infile: the SWAT-CUP file you use as template
* nlines: the number of lines in the header, this varies depending on the file you are trying to write and whether your project is a SUFI2 or PSO project.
* weight: a single number or a vector indicating the weight of the flow data relative to the other input data. The objective function weights will be $\sum{weight/np*Obs_i}$  

Before you can run this code, it is wise to make a copy of your "observed.txt"/"observed_rch.txt" file from the SUFI2.in or PSO.in folder and put this in the working directory. This means that if things go wrong you still have a original file available.

*nlines input*  
Note particulary the input `nlines`, which is a different number depending on whether you use the PSO or SUFI2 version.

```{r demonstrateMF}
# Demonstrate: writing files for 2008 - 2011
# read in flow data
flow_df <- 
  readRDS(file = "data/SantaLuciaFlow/AllSantaLuciaFlowdata.RDS")
# original Q is in m^3/sec
# SWAT also needs cumecs


# write observed.txt
# FOR SUFI2 use nlines = 16, for PSO use nlines = 14
# below is for SUFI2
swatcup_MFformat(df_flow = flow_df,
                 date.format = "%Y-%m-%d",
                 st.date ="2008-01-01", end.date ="2011-12-31",
                 outfile = "data/observed_MF.txt" ,
                 infile = "data/observed.txt", nlines = 16, 
                 weight = 0.2)

# write observed_rch.txt
swatcup_MFformat(df_flow = flow_df,
                 date.format = "%Y-%m-%d",
                 st.date ="2008-01-01", end.date ="2011-12-31",
                 infile = "data/observed_rch_MF.txt" ,
                 outfile = "data/observed_rch.txt", nlines = 6,
                 weight = 0.2)

```

## Nutrient data  
This same function `swatcup_MFformat` can also include nutrient data in combination with the flow data. So if you have nutrient data available for a catchment, you can create a similar list as for the flow data. This should be a simple list, where each individual nutrient is a separate data frame for each individual station.

The example below demonstrates the function to include the flow and nutrient data at the Paso Pache station, but the nutrient data is only available between 2011 and 2015.

```{r demonstrateMF_nutr}
# Demonstrate: writing files for 2010 - 2015
# read in the nutrient data
nutrient_df <- 
  readRDS(file = "data/SantaLuciaFlow/SantaLuciaNutrdata.RDS")


# write observed.txt
# FOR SUFI2 use nlines = 16, for PSO use nlines = 14
# below is for SUFI2
swatcup_MFformat(df_flow = flow_df[1],
                 df_nutrient = nutrient_df[1:6],
                 date.format = "%Y-%m-%d",
                 st.date ="2010-01-01", end.date ="2015-12-31",
                 outfile = "data/observed_nutr.txt" ,
                 infile = "data/observed.txt", nlines = 16, 
                 weight = c(0.5,rep(0.5/6,6)))

# write observed_rch.txt
swatcup_MFformat(df_flow = flow_df[1],
                 df_nutrient = nutrient_df[1:6],
                 date.format = "%Y-%m-%d",
                 st.date ="2010-01-01", end.date ="2015-12-31",
                 infile = "data/observed_rch.txt" ,
                 outfile = "data/observed_rch_nutr.txt", nlines = 6,
                 weight = c(0.5,rep(0.5/6,6)))

```


# MODIS_ts
This function reads the directory indicated by *MODISdir* and looks for files with the extension pattern given by *patt*. The output is a timeseries of values stacked for all the points that are available. There are 5 columns in the output:  

* Year  
* JDay (Julian Day)  
* value (of actual ET in mm)  
* Point (a number in the catchment)  
* Date (the actual date in Y-m-d)

```{r MODIS_ts}
# demonstrate
# Create a single file with all the MODIS ET data for all points
ET_Data <- MODIS_ts("MODIS/SantaLucia")
# show the data
head(ET_Data)

```


# swatcup_ETformat
This function encapsulates a few separate functions and uses them to write the input files for SWAT-CUP in the right format for both ET and flow data.
It can write:  

- observed.txt
- observed_sub.txt
- observed_rch.txt

This function takes the following input

* df, this is a data frame with flow data or ET data, the output of `MODIS_ts()`
* df_flow this is an optional dataframe with flow data if df is ET data
* date.format is a definition of the date format in case the date format in the flow data is incorrect
* st.date: the starting date for the output. **this needs to be within all the different data sets that you would like to use.**
* end.date: the end date for the output
* outfile: the SWAT-CUP file you want to write
* infile: the SWAT-CUP file you use as template
* nlines: the number of lines in the header
* Flow: a boolean indicating whether or not flow data is included
* weight: a single number or a vector indicating the weight of the flow data relative to the other input data. The objective function weights will be $weight*flow + \sum{weight/np*Obs_i}$  

Before you can run this code, it is wise to make a copy of your "observed.txt"/"observed_rch.txt/observed_sub.txt" file from the SUFI2.in or PSO.in folder and put this in the working directory. This means that if things go wrong you still have a original file available.

*nlines input*  
Note particulary the input `nlines`, which is a different number depending on whether you use the PSO or SUFI2 version.

```{r swatcup_ETformat}
# Demonstrate: writing files for 2008 - 2011
# read in flow data
flowdata <- readRDS(file="data/SantaLuciaflow/SantaLucia.RDS")
head(flowdata)
# original Q is in m^3/sec
# SWAT needs cumecs

# write observed_sub.txt
swatcup_ETformat(ET_Data, df_flow = NULL, date.format = "%Y-%m-%d",
                             "2008-01-01", "2011-12-31",
                 outfile = "data/observed_sub_ET.txt" ,
                 infile = "data/observed_sub.txt", 
                 6, weight= 0.1)



# write observed.txt
# FOR SUFI2 use nlines = 16, for PSO use nlines = 14
# below is for SUFI2

                 outfile = "data/observed_ET.txt" ,
                 infile = "data/observed.txt", 
                 nlines = 16, Flow = TRUE, 
                 weight = 0.1)

# write observed_rch.txt
swatcup_ETformat(flowdata,df_flow=NULL,
                 date.format = "%Y-%m-%d",
                 "2008-01-01", "2011-12-31",
                 outfile = "data/observed_rch_ET.txt" ,
                 infile = "data/observed_rch.txt", nlines = 6, 
                 Flow = TRUE)

# Now test putting in weights relative to the size of the subcatchment
subbasin_data <- read.csv("data/subbasins_SantaLucia_alldata.csv")

# calculate weights from relative areas
f_w <- 0.1 # flow weight
ET_w <- subbasin_data$Area/sum(subbasin_data$Area)*(1-f_w)
 w_in <- c(f_w, ET_w)

 # now try to write the file
# FOR SUFI2 use nlines = 16, for PSO use nlines = 14
# below is for SUFI2
swatcup_ETformat(ET_Data, df_flow = flowdata,
                  date.format = "%Y-%m-%d",
                  "2008-01-01", "2011-12-31",

                 "data/observed.txt", nlines = 16,
